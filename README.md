# Pokemon_Game
This is a project in Python to help me learn Object Oriented Programming and some Software Design. I will also try to write clean and efficient code. 

The aim of this initially is to set up a simple game of Pokemon where I can have features such as:
- Pick a starter Pokemon
- Pokemon exists within a database 
- Pokemon exist as objects and I can initialise them by looking up their names and relevant attributes
- The user or "trainer" can then use their pokemon to have a battle
- A Pokemon battle to feature similar setup to that of the main games
- The Pokemon will then gain experience points and level accordingly
- Levelling will have its appropriate effect on the pokemon's stats. 
- Create some AI trainers with sample pokemon and levels to have mock fights with
